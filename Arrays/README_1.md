# Array Operations in C++


This project provides a simple and flexible C++ program for performing various operations on arrays, including displaying elements, summing them, finding the maximum value, and searching for a target value.

## Features
- Display array elements.
- Calculate the sum of all elements.
- Find the maximum element.
- Search for a specific target value.

## Usage

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (such as `g++`).

### Compilation
To compile the program, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
g++ -o array_operations array_operations.cpp
```

### Execution
Run the compiled program:

```bash
./array_operations
```

### Sample Output
```text
Array elements: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 
Sum of elements: 28
Maximum element: 7
Is 4 in the array? Yes
```
